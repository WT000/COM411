# go through each character similarly to membership file, use a for loop just like in there
# when we pass x, we could add 1 to a counter or something
# the counter would = 2 when we reach the second market meaning we know that we've just passed it, we can then end the loop

# to look through characters, use the entered sequence and get the len of it (it will become the maximum number in the for loop)

# counter = 0

# for characters in range(0, len(user_input), 1):
# if user_input[characters] = marker:
# counter += 1
# if counter >= 2
# break
